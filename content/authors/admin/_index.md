I am a computer science and physics student at Goethe University.
My interests are in Data Science, Simulation Science, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
Non-academically I am mostly interested in astronomy, space aviation and enviromental topics.
I also occasionally write blog posts about these topics.
You can find them and my completed and ongoing projects down below.
