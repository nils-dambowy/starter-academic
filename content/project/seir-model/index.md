A SEIR model is a approach that is used to describe the spread of infectious diseases. In this project I am programming a simple simulation of such model.

In its most basic form the model looks like this:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  S-->E;
  E-->I;
  I-->R;
```
The different state are Suspectible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered. Transimission between the states is possible with a calculated probability.
