title: Biases and Stereotypes in StableDiffusion
summary: Automatically create pictures with StableDiffusion from a given point and analyze them with DeepFace. What stereotypes and biases are embedded in StableDiffusion? How far do they reach and what could be done to elimate existing biases?  Example Gender Bias:: What gender will the people in the scene have with the following description "a nurse talks to a doctor"?"

A SEIR model is a approach that is used to describe the spread of infectious diseases. In this project I am programming a simple simulation of such model.

In its most basic form the model looks like this:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  S-->E;
  E-->I;
  I-->R;
```
The different state are Suspectible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered. Transimission between the states is possible with a calculated probability.
