title: An introduction to rigid bodies
subtitle: ''
summary: A rigid body is an object that does not bend, deform, or change its shape under the influence of external forces. This means that all points in the object remain at a fixed distance from each other, and there is no stretching, squeezing, or twisting of the object.

A rigid body is an object that does not bend, deform, or change its shape under the influence of external forces. This means that all points in the object remain at a fixed distance from each other, and there is no stretching, squeezing, or twisting of the object.

This simplifies the analysis of the object's motion, making it easier to apply the laws of physics to describe its behavior. For example, if we know the external forces acting on a rigid body, we can predict how it will move or rotate without having to consider any changes in its shape or size.
